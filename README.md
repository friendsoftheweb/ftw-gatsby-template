# FTW Gatsby Template

This is a template for setting up a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) site
using our current, preferred toolkit, configurations, and conventions for:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org)

It includes some other scripts and basic components following our conventions,
and not the unused boilerplate in the standard Gatsby starter.

# FTW Gatsby Template

A project built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), a static site generator
using [React](https://reactjs.org).

If you have any problems setting up or running the project, please file an
issue.

## Prerequisites

- [Node 12.16.3](https://nodejs.org/en/):
  [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is recommended to manage Node
  versions
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/): manages JavaScript Dependencies
- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/)

## Setup

In the project directory, install dependencies with:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Development Server

Run the development server with:

```sh
$ yarn start
```

View the site in a browser at `localhost:8000`

### Validating Javascript

A few tools are used to enhance and validate JavaScript. It's recommended to
install plugins for these in your text editor, if available, to validate and
format on save.

- Typescript is used to type-check JavaScript. Run `$ yarn types:check` to check
  manually.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) formats JavaScript and CSS, enforcing
  consistency and reducing incidental changes. Run `$ yarn format` to manually
  format.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org) checks for some kinds of JavaScript errors. Run
  `$ yarn lint` to manually check.

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes the app gets into a broken state that does not provide meaningful
errors. This happens especially when changing the structure of data or files
names. In this case try:

- Restarting the development server
- Check the console running `$ yarn start` for errors
- Run `$ yarn clean` to remove cache and build folders and restart

### Updating Dependencies

After pulling changes, update all installed dependencies to the locked versions
with:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

## Deploying

The site is expected to be deployed via Github Pages which can be triggered
with:

```sh
$ yarn  deploy
```
